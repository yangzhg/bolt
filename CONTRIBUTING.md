## Development Environment Setup

Bolt uses **Conan 2** for dependency management and a Makefile to drive its build and test processes. You can set up the environment automatically using our helper script, or configure it manually if you prefer granular control over your toolchain.

### Prerequisites

- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, CentOS 7+) or macOS (Experimental).

- **Compiler**: GCC 10+ or Clang 16+ (Must support C++17).
- **Build Tools**: CMake 3.25+, Ninja.
- **Dependency Manager**: Conan 2.0+.

### Setup Options

#### Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)

Run the helper script to bootstrap your development environment:

```Bash
scripts/setup-dev-env.sh
```
**⚠️ Important: What this script does** This script is "opinionated" and performs the following actions. Please review them to ensure they fit your workflow:

1. **Python Environment (Miniconda)**:
   - Checks for `~/miniconda3`.
   - **If missing**: Automatically downloads and installs Miniconda locally.
   - **Shell Modification**: Appends the Miniconda path to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).
   - Installs Python dependencies (including `conan`) into this environment.
2. **Conan Configuration**:
   - Sets the C++ standard to `gnu17` in the default Conan profile.
   - **Clones & Patches Recipes**: Calls `install-bolt-deps.sh` to download a specific version of `conan-center-index` to `~/.conan2/conan-center-index` and applies Bolt-specific patches (required for `folly`, `arrow`, etc.).
   - Configures local Conan remotes to prioritize these patched recipes.
3. **Git Hooks**: Installs `pre-commit` hooks for automatic code formatting.

#### Option 2: Manual Setup (For Advanced Users)

If you prefer to manage your own Python environment (e.g., via system packages, pyenv, or poetry) or use a specific compiler, you can skip the setup script. However, you **must** still configure the Conan dependencies manually.

1. **Install Python Dependencies**:

   ```Bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. **Configure Conan Dependencies (Crucial)**: Bolt relies on patched versions of several libraries. You must run the dependency installation script to set up the local recipe index and apply necessary patches:

   ```Bash
   # This sets up the local conan-center-index with required patches
   # and configures the 'bolt-local' and 'bolt-cci-local' remotes.
   scripts/install-bolt-deps.sh
   ```

### Platform Specific Notes

- **First-Time Build**: The first build will compile dependencies from source (e.g., Folly, Arrow), which can take a significant amount of time. Please be patient.

- **macOS Users**: Ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed:

  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```

## Fork and PR Workflow

We follow the standard GitHub fork-and-PR workflow. For details, please refer to [workflow](./doc/workflow.md):

1. **Fork** the `bytedance/bolt` repository to your personal GitHub account.

2. **Clone** your fork locally and create a new topic branch from your target branch (usually `main`).

3. **Develop and commit** your changes on the topic branch. Each commit should represent a logical unit of work.

4. **Push** the topic branch to your remote fork.

5. **Open a** **pull request** to the upstream repository with a clear title and description.


## Building and Testing

Bolt's build and test workflows are centralized in the root Makefile. You can run `make help` to see all common targets and their descriptions.

### Common Targets

```Bash
# Standard builds (for presto)
make debug        # Build a debug version
make release      # Build an optimized release version

# Build with tests and run them
make release_with_test       # Build a release version with tests enabled
make unittest                # Run unit tests in the debug build directory
make unittest_release        # Run unit tests in the release build directory

# Code coverage (requires a debug build with coverage flags)
make unittest_coverage

# Example build for Spark/Gluten (see README)
make release_spark
```

**Notes**:

- Build artifacts are placed in `_build/<BuildType>` (e.g., `_build/Release`).

- Unit tests are driven by CTest (using GoogleTest). `make unittest[_release]` invokes `ctest` in the corresponding build directory.

- You can set variables like `BUILD_VERSION` and `FILE_SYSTEM` as needed (see the Makefile for details). For example:


```Bash
make release_spark BUILD_VERSION=main
```


### Working with IDE

Vscode guide in [English](./doc/vscode-config-en.md) or [Chinese](./doc/vscode-config.md).

## Code Style and Static Analysis

To maintain consistent code quality and style, please run the following checks before submitting your changes.

- **C++ Standard**: We use **C++17**.

- **Formatting**: We use `clang-format-14`.

- **Naming**: Follow the [Style Guide](./doc/coding-style.md).


### Formatting (clang-format)

Bolt uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to manage all git hooks, so clang-format checks/formatting can also be done within `pre-commit`.

If you have executed `scripts/setup-dev-env.sh`, then `pre-commit` and all the pre-defined git hooks are already installed. When you commit code using `git commit ...`, clang-format will be executed automatically, you only need to `git add ...` the formatted file again.

By the way, you can execute `pre-commit install` to install all git hooks manually.

You also can use below command to format manually, but please ensure clang-format version is equal to `14.0.6`. Different version clang-format may has different default behavior.

```Bash
# Run the format check (same as in CI)
make clang-format-check

# format on a single file
clang-format -i -style=file path/to/your/file.cpp

# format all files in batch
find bolt -name "*.h" -o -name "*.cpp" | xargs clang-format -i -style=file
```

### Static Analysis (clang-tidy)

The repository provides a `.clang-tidy` configuration and a helper script at `scripts/run-clang-tidy.py`.

#### Prerequisites
It is best to run this after a successful build, as it relies on the compilation database (`compile_commands.json`). By default, the script looks for this database in `_build/Release` or the current directory.

```Bash
# First, create a release build to generate the compile database (compile_commands.json)
make release

```

#### Basic Usage
You can run the script on specific files, directories, or based on git changes.

```Bash
# 1. Run on specific files
python3 scripts/run-clang-tidy.py src/path/to/file.cpp src/other/file.h

# 2. Run recursively on a directory (New feature)
# This will scan all .cpp/.h/.cc etc. files in 'src/'
python3 scripts/run-clang-tidy.py -d src/

# 3. Parallel execution (Recommended for speed)
# Use '-j' to specify number of threads (defaults to half of CPU cores)
python3 scripts/run-clang-tidy.py -d src/ -j 12
```

#### Advanced Filtering & Configuration
The script includes default filters to skip tests and benchmarks. You can customize this behavior.

```Bash
# Exclude specific files using Regex
# (Default excludes: tests/, benchmarks/, *Test.cpp, etc.)
python3 scripts/run-clang-tidy.py -d src/ --exclude "legacy/|.*_generated.cpp"

# Specify a custom build path if not in _build/Release
python3 scripts/run-clang-tidy.py -d src/ -p build/debug/

# Use a specific clang-tidy binary or config file
python3 scripts/run-clang-tidy.py -d src/ \
    --clang-tidy-binary /usr/bin/clang-tidy-14 \
    --config-file .clang-tidy-strict
```

#### Focused Checks (Git Awareness)
To save time, you can check only the files or lines changed in a specific commit.

```Bash
# Check only the lines changed in the last commit (Incremental check)
python3 scripts/run-clang-tidy.py --commit HEAD~1 src/

# Check files changed relative to the main branch
python3 scripts/run-clang-tidy.py --commit origin/main src/
```

#### Auto-Fixing

```Bash
# Automatically apply fixes (Use with caution and review changes)
python3 scripts/run-clang-tidy.py --fix src/
```

#### CI/CD & Automation Features

**GitHub Actions Auto-Annotations** The script contains built-in logic to detect GitHub Actions environments. When running in a CI pipeline, it translates clang-tidy errors into GitHub Annotations, allowing them to show up directly in Pull Request diff views.

**Standard Input (Stdin)** You can pipe file paths directly into the script using the `-` argument:

```Bash
find src/ -name "Legacy*.cpp" | python3 scripts/run-clang-tidy.py -
```

**Environment Variables**

- `BUILD_`BUILD_PATH`: Overrides the default search path for `compile_commands.json` (alternative to `-p`).
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS`: Triggers the CI-friendly output format (automatically set by GitHub).

#### Script Options Reference

| Option                                    | Description                                                  |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FILES` or `-`                            | List of specific files. Use `-` to read file list from stdin. |
| `-d`, `--directory`--directory`           | Recursively scan a directory for `.cpp`, `.h`, `.cc`, `.cxx`, etc. |
| `-j`, `--jobs`                            | Number of parallel threads (Batch size is fixed at 5 files per job). |
| `--commit`                                | **Incremental Mode**: Analyze only modified lines relative to a git ref. |
| `--fix`--fix`                             | Apply suggested fixes to the files automatically.            |
| `--exclude`                               | Regex to ignore files. Default includes tests, benchmarks, and test files. |
| `-p`                                      | Path to build dir. Falls back to `BUILD_PATH` env var, then `_build/Release`, then `.`. |
| `--clang-tidy-binary`--clang-tidy-binary` | Custom path to executable (e.g. `/usr/bin/clang-tidy-15`).   |
| `--config-file`                           | Path to custom config. If omitted, uses standard `.clang-tidy` lookup (`--`--format-style=file`). |

The script uses different check sets for test and main code. Please ensure your changes introduce no new warnings before committing.

### Code of Conduct

The Bolt project and all its contributors are governed by a [Code of Conduct.](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html) By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Unit Testing

- **Framework**: We use GoogleTest (see `bolt/bolt/expression/tests/*` for example).

- **Coverage**: Bug fixes and new features must be accompanied by minimal, reproducible unit tests with sufficient assertions. Avoid flaky tests or those with external dependencies.

- **Location**: Place test files in the `tests` directory of the corresponding module, following existing naming and structure conventions.

- **Execution**:


```Bash
make unittest           # Build in debug and run ctest in _build/Debug
make unittest_release   # Build in release and run ctest in _build/Release
make unittest_coverage  # generate a coverage report
make unittest_release_spark # Tests in Spark

# run a specific test
cd bolt/_build/Release/bolt/functions/sparksql/tests
./bolt_functions_spark_test --gtest_filter=SparkCastExprTest.stringToTimestamp
```

### Sanitizers (Crucial for C++)

Before submitting a complex PR, it is highly recommended to run tests with AddressSanitizer (ASAN) and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSAN) to catch memory leaks and undefined behaviors.

```Bash
ENABLE_ASAN=True make unittest_release
```
